<strong>Hey, I'm Stelios Miskedakis as known Devsmiskedakis</strong>
<hr>
I'm a high school student who lives in the Greece. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future).  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages, My Portfolio and learning how to progam.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to Hacking, code, Cooking, and Games in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was "Hello World!"
